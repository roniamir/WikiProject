                    <p>Delta Air Lines has reported a pre-tax loss of $15.6 billion for financial 2020, representing a loss per share of $19.49 on total revenue of $17.1 billion.

                        In the December quarter alone, the carrier saw pre-tax losses of $1.1 billion.
                        
                        “Our December quarter results capped the toughest year in Delta’s history,” said Ed Bastian, Delta chief executive.
                        
                        “While our challenges continue in 2021, I am optimistic this will be a year of recovery and a turning point that results in an even stronger Delta returning to revenue growth, profitability and free cash generation.”
                        
                        Total operating expenses at Delta, which included $4.3 billion of Covid-19 related and other items, decreased $10.8 billion in 2020 over the prior year.</p>

                    <img src="Half_Moon_-_NS_2020_4.jpg" alt="half_moon">
                    <p>The first thing you notice as you arrive at Half Moon, driving through the manicured lawns and well-maintained tropical gardens, is the incredible ocean view. This is a delight which will consistently meet you throughout your visit to the venerable resort in Montego Bay. As you enter reception through the pavilion-style lobby, you are granted the luxury of checking-in while watching the ocean slowly welcome you not only to the hotel, but Jamaica too. After a long flight, it is always a pleasure to be met not only with the views over the ocean and the humbling Blue Mountains in the background, but also a rum cocktail, setting the tone for a remarkably pleasant trip.</p>
